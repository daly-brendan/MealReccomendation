This will operate as the read.me file for this project

THis project will be my first attempt at a solo project in Python.

This program will be able to make a meal reccomendation and then pull a recipe for this reccomendation from google and then pull a wine pairing for said recipe.

This will be all visibple on my GitHub repository for this project.

I will most likely have to build my own API for this since I want to learn as much as possible for something like this and become more skilled in Python and backend dev

acidic_wines = 15, 13, 12, 9, 8, 7
fruity_wines = 16 ,13, 11, 10, 8
oaky_wines = 14, 10, 7


hearty_meals = 2, 7, 8, 12
Light_meals = 0, 9, 10
fun_meals = 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
classic_meals = 1, 3, 7, 11, 12

Anything under here will act as a works cited incase I need to use any kind of skeleton code
