This will operate as the read.me file for this project

THis project will be my first attempt at a solo project in Python.

This program will be able to make a meal reccomendation and then pull a recipe for this reccomendation from google and then pull a wine pairing for said recipe.

This will be all visibple on my GitHub repository for this project.

I will most likely have to build my own API for this since I want to learn as much as possible for something like this and become more skilled in Python and backend dev

#####
Anything under here will act as a works cited incase I need to use any kind of skeleton code
